# Module 02 - Creating Containers & Documents

[< Previous Module](../modules/module01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module >](../modules/module02a.md)

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

An Azure Cosmos DB container is where data is stored. Unlike most relational databases which scale up with larger VM sizes, Azure Cosmos DB scales out. Data is stored on one or more servers, called partitions. To increase throughput or storage, more partitions are added. This provides a virtually an unlimited amount of throughput and storage for a container. When a container is created, you need to supply a partition key. This is a property you select from your documents to store. The value of that property is then used to route data to the partition to be written, updated, or deleted. It can also be used in the WHERE clause in queries for efficient data retrieval.

## :dart: Objectives

* Create a Container and add documents


> :bulb: **Did you know?**
>
> There are 2 types of partitions Logical and Physical. 
> A logical partition consists of a set of items that have the same partition key. For example, in a container that contains data about food nutrition, all items contain a foodGroup property. The underlying storage mechanism for data in Azure Cosmos DB is called a physical partition.

> In this module we will walk through how to create a container and documents using data explorer.

## 1. Create a container using Azure portal

1. Navigate to Open the Data Explorer pane, and select **Open Full Screen**.

    ![OpenFullScreen](../images/module02/DataExp.png)

2. Select the Subscription and Cosmos DB account that we created earlier.

    ![Data Explorer-Subcription-Account](../images/module02/Fullscreen-sub-acct-settings.png)

3. click **New Container** from the top left corner, provide the following details. Select **OK**.

    ![New Container](../images/module02/ContainerSettings.png)


## 2. Creating Documents from Data Explorer

1. Expand the **Families** and select Items(another name for documents).

2. Select **New Item** from the menu.

   ![New Item](../images/module02/NewItem.png)

3. Type in the JSON for my first family. Omit the id when you create a new document. The id property GUID gets generated automatically.

        {
            "familyName": "Smith",
            "address": {
                "addressLine": "123 Main Street",
                "city": "Chicago",
                "state": "IL",
                "zipCode": "60601"
            },
            "parents": [
                "Peter",
                "Alice"
            ],
            "kids": [
                "Adam",
                "Jacqueline",
                "Joshua"
            ]
        }


4. Select **Save** you'll see the id property with a GUID value is created.

5. Let's add anther item with these values:

        {
            "familyName": "James",
            "address": {
                "addressLine": "6890 Choachman Dr.",
                "city": "Chicago",
                "state": "IL",
                "zipCode": "60603"
            },
            "parents": [
                "David",
                "Diana"
            ],
            "kids": [
                "Ava",
                "Brad"
            ],
            "pets": [
                "Tiger"
            ]
        }

6. Let's update the addressline to 
    "133 Wheat Ridge Ln."
    
7. Select **Update** 

8. Click on the **...** in Items to bring up a query editor.

   ![New Query](../images/module02/NewQuery.png)

9. Write and Execute these queries:

    SELECT * FROM c
    WHERE c.address.city = 'Chicago'

    SELECT * FROM c
    WHERE c.address.zipCode = '60601'

    SELECT * FROM c
    WHERE IS_DEFINED(c.pets)

    SELECT * FROM c
    WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(c.kids) > 2


## 5. Uploading a JSON file with multiple items

1. click New Container from the top left corner, provide the following details. Select OK.

    ![New Container](../images/module02/Cities.png)

2. Expand **Cities** and Click on **CityPopulation**

3. Select **Upload Item** from the menu and browse to the extrated file and select citie.json.

4. Click **Upload**

5. Run these queries:

    SELECT cp.city, cp.state, cp.rank FROM CityPopulation cp

    SELECT cp.city, cp.state, cp.rank FROM CityPopulation cp
    WHERE StringToNumber(cp.rank) between 30 AND 50

    SELECT cp.city, cp.state, cp.rank FROM CityPopulation cp
    WHERE StringToNumber(cp.rank) between 30 AND 50
    Order by cp.growth_from_2000_to_2013 DESC

    SELECT AVG(StringToNumber(cp.population)) AveragePopulation, COUNT(cp.city) Cities, cp.state 
    FROM CityPopulation cp
    Group by cp.state 

## 6. Using NoteBook


## :mortar_board: Knowledge Check

1. What type of object can help organize data sources into logical groups?

    A ) Buckets  
    B ) Collections  
    C ) Groups  

2. At which point does Microsoft Purview begin to populate the data map with assets?

    A ) After a Microsoft Purview account is created  
    B ) After a Data Source has been registered  
    C ) After a Data Source has been scanned

3. Which of the following attributes is **not** automatically assigned to an asset as a result of the system-built scanning functionality?

    A ) Technical Metadata (e.g. Fully Qualified Name, Path, Schema, etc)  
    B ) Glossary Terms (e.g. column `Sales Tax` is tagged with the `Sales Tax` glossary term)  
    C ) Classifications (e.g. column `ccnum` is tagged with the `Credit Card Number` classification)
