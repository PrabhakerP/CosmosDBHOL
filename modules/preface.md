## APIs in Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB offers multiple database APIs, which include NoSQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL Cassandra, Gremlin, and Table. By using these APIs, you can model real world data using documents, key-value, graph, and column-family data models. These APIs allow your applications to treat Azure Cosmos DB as if it were various other databases technologies, without the overhead of management, and scaling approaches. Azure Cosmos DB helps you to use the ecosystems, tools, and skills you already have for data modeling and querying with its various APIs.

All the APIs offer automatic scaling of storage and throughput, flexibility, and performance guarantees. There's no one best API, and you may choose any one of the APIs to build your application.

## Solutions that benefit from Azure Cosmos DB

Web, mobile, gaming, and IoT application that handle massive amounts of data, reads, and writes at a global scale with near-real response times for various data will benefit from Azure Cosmos DB. Azure Cosmos DB's guaranteed high availability, high throughput, low latency, and tunable consistency are huge advantages when building these types of applications. Learn about how Azure Cosmos DB can be used to build IoT and telematics, retail and marketing, gaming and web and mobile applications.
