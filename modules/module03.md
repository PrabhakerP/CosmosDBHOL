[< Previous Module](../modules/module02a.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module >](../modules/module04.md)

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source interactive developer environment (IDE) that's designed to create, execute, and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

Azure Cosmos DB built-in Jupyter Notebooks are directly integrated into the Azure portal and your Azure Cosmos DB accounts, making them convenient and easy to use. Developers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts can use the familiar Jupyter Notebooks experience to perform common tasks. These common tasks include:

    data exploration
    data cleaning
    data transformations
    numerical simulations
    statistical modeling
    data visualization
    machine learning

> While the **Microsoft Purview Governance Portal** is provided as the default user experience, customers and partners can interface with the underlying platform using the [Microsoft Purview REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/purview/). The openness of the platform enables the possibility of integrating Microsoft Purview with custom user interfaces as well as the ability to perform read/write operations programmatically.
